## System rules
- Thematics first, always
- Stamina dice are always d8s. They are never changed. They are a literal pile of dice.
- You never get more stamina dice than used. You can't use 1 stamina die to get 2d8 damage. You can only give up stamina die to cause conditions, add conditions on top, add small modifiers like boosts or rerolls, etc
- Powers should not manipulate weapon dice except through rerolls
- Powers should only rarely give advantage and never multiple stacks of advantage - Stacking is from multiple sources only.
- Powers should not use auto crits as those can exponentially increase the power of other features.
- Attack bonuses should very rarely be used. When used, they should be limited to +1 per resource and never stack with advantage
- Powers should not allow crit-fishing. This can be avoided with a save inbetween an attack and the damage or other means
- Trap options will never be provided by the system. Options should be viable choices.
- Maneuvers are intended to never have concentration.
